                    <p>Hinulugan Taktak is a waterfall located in Taktak Road, Brgy. Dela Paz, Antipolo City.<br>
                      It was once a popular tourist destination famous for its refreshing and idyllic falls.<br>
                       It has been considered as one of the most important landscapes in the Province of Rizal,<br>
                        playing a role in the province’s legendary history and a part in Antipolo’s natural and cultural heritage.<br>
                         Legend has it that during the 16th century, a local priest was forced by the local people to drop the bell in the river due to its harsh and unbearably loud sound when rung during Angelus; thus the name “Hinulugan Taktak,” which literally means “where the bell was dropped.”

                    <p>In 1760, the parish of Our Lady of Light was canonically erected.
                         The vernacular translation of the parish’s titular, as immortalized in the first Tagalog novena to the patroness published in 1884, is “Ina ng Caliuanagan”.
                          Our Lady of Light is depicted in a painting which is presently enshrined and venerated in the church as a rendition of the original icon which was brought to Cainta 
                          in 1727 from Ferrara, Italy by Fr. Bartolommeo Cavanti, SJ. The original painting was burned when the church was razed by fire and destroyed in 1899.</p>
