                    <h2>HIGANTES FESTIVAL</h2>
                    <p>Municipality of Angono Rizal</p>
                    <p>Higantes Festival is a secular celebration initiated by the Municipality of Angono to express gratitude to its patron Saint Clement,
                         in which the parade of giants is held on Sunday before the town feast on November 23.
                        Base on Angono folklore, the ‘higante’ was used as symbol of agrarian protest during the waning years of the Spanish colonization when Angono was a hacienda (large tract of lands).
